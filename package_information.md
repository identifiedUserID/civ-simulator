| `constants.py`  | Central repository for game-wide constants.              | Define colors, screen dimensions, tile size, terrain/resource/unit/building types, default stats (HP, speed, rates), costs, names, noise settings.   |
| `tile.py`       | Represents a single square on the game map grid.         | Store coordinates, terrain type, biome, resource type/amount, building presence, walkability. Handle resource gathering, respawn timers, drawing.    |
| `map.py`        | Manages the game world grid and procedural generation.   | Generate terrain/biomes using noise, place initial resources, store/retrieve Tile objects, find nearest entities, handle resource respawns, draw map. |
| `building.py`   | Defines structures players can build.                    | Base Building class (coords, type, HP). Subclasses (TownHall, House) with specific attributes/logic (e.g., spawning, pop cap). Handle drawing.    |
| `unit.py`       | Defines mobile entities in the game (workers, enemies). | Base Unit class (coords, type, HP, state, speed, movement). Subclasses (Worker, Enemy) with specific AI, actions (gather, attack), drawing.        |
| `ui.py`         | Manages the User Interface elements (side panel).        | Create/manage sliders, buttons. Handle UI events. Draw resource counts, population, sliders, build icons.                                         |
| `game.py`       | Main game orchestrator. Ties all components together.    | Initialize Pygame, create core objects (`GameMap`, `UI`, etc.). Run the main game loop, handle events (input, dragging), update game state, manage units/buildings, check win/loss, call draw methods. |
| `main.py`       | Entry point for the application.                         | Import the `Game` class and start the game instance.                                                                                               |
| `requirements.txt`| Lists external Python libraries needed.                 | Specify `pygame` and `noise` for pip install.                                                                                                     |
| `README.md`     | Provides information about the project.                | Explain features, installation, how to play, future work.                                                                                         |
| `install.bat`   | (Windows) Automates installation.                      | Install requirements via pip, create desktop shortcut.                                                                                            |
